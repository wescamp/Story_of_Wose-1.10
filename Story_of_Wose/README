This Wesnoth campaign is released under GPL v2.0 or later.

All art is GPL. Don't come looking for the layered images that
you think the png images came from. The pngs are the originals.

Please don't wmlindent for me. My screen is 80 colums and I
nested tags so deep that wmlindent will cause nested wrapping.
I have already wmlindented the files that are suitable anyway.
If you run wmlindent I will revert that revision and all
following revisions. You have been warned.
